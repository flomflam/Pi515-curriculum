#Booleans
#Can print out if a math statement is true or false
#print(10>9)
#print(10==9)

#Can also determine if string are found within other strings
#someTxt = "Red is my favorite color."
#print("Blue" in someTxt)

#Run different code depending on if its true or false
#a = 200
#b = 33
#if b > a:
#  print("b is greater than a")
#else:
#  print("b is not greater than a")
#this is what is known as an if else statement

#Everything can be a boolean!
#print(bool("Green"))
#print(bool(21))
#print(bool(()), bool([]), bool({}), bool(0), bool(None), bool(False), bool(""))

#Responses can be saved off in what is known as a function
#def func():
#  return True
#if func():
#  print(“Yes”)
#else:
#  print(“No”)

#Can verify if a type is what you expect or not and get a boolean value back
#x = 200
#print(isinstance(x, str))
#print(isinstance(x, int))
